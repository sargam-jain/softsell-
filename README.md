## 🧠 AI Chatbot Details

A basic LLM-style chatbot is implemented using [Cleverbot.io](https://cleverbot.io)'s public API, simulating a support experience:

- Example questions are preloaded:  
  _"How do I sell my license?"_, _"What license types do you accept?"_, etc.
- Responses are returned in real-time.
- Frontend-only implementation (no backend required).
- **OpenAI integration** was attempted but replaced with Cleverbot due to CORS/security restrictions on frontend APIs.
